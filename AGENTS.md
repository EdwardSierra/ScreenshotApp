Coding guidelines:

 - Write testable code and create tests
 - Make sure all tests pass after you make code changes
 - Do not repeat yourself, write reusable functions whenever possible 
 - Each module, class, function, etc should have a single responsibility 
 - Separate modules/classes into their own files to make the code easier to manage (avoid monolith code files)
 - Use extensive logging of each action and write the logs to a file to assist in debugging should something go wrong 
 - Comment at the top of each class, module, function, etc with a description of what it does, its inputs, and its outputs 
 - After code changes, update the readme file with any necessary information for the user if needed
 - Keep the .gitignore file updated 
 - After code changes, commit your changes to the 'codex-changes' branch (create if not exist)

Notes:
 - Add any useful or necessary notes about the code here for other developers.
